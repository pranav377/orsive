## Full local development

If you use a Code Editor/IDE that supports devcontainers (eg: VSCode), you can easily setup your development environment in minutes! Here's how to do it for VSCode users:

### Usage

Prerequisite: See [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_system-requirements)

Open VSCode, then:

- Install the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension.
- Open VSCode and bring up the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).
- Type `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container`, this will build the container with Node.Js, MongoDB, MeiliSearch and Gorse installed

### Run

`npm run dev`

That's itðŸ‘Œ
